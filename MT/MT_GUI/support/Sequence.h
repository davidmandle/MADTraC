/** @class MT_Sequence
 *
 * A time-based sequence that is executed by a separate thread for
 * (relatively) precise timing.
 *
 * The main concept is to load the sequence with a list of event
 * times with MT_Sequence::pushTime (which can be added out of
 * order).  Then, when the sequence is started with
 * MT_Sequence::doSequence, a thread is spawned that triggers a call
 * to the virtual function MT_Sequence::onEvent after each event
 * time.  After the thread is done, it calls the virtual function
 * MT_Sequence::onDone.
 *
 * The sequence can be forced to stop with MT_Sequence::stopSequence.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 * First, derive a class from MT_Sequence:
 * @code
 * // Derive from MT_Sequence to override event fcns
 * class mySequence : public MT_Sequence
 * {
 * private:
 *     // will be the recipient of event notifications
 *     SomeObj* m_pParent;
 * public:
 *     // ctor should set parent
 *     mySequence(SomeObj* parent)
 *      : MT_Sequence(), m_pParent(parent){};
 *     // dtor should call haltThread to ensure onDone is called
 *     ~mySequence(){haltThread();};
 *
 *     // Sequence event handler
 *     void onEvent(unsigned int state)
 *       {m_pParent->handleEvent(state);};
 *       
 *     // Finish event handler
 *     void onDone(){m_pParent->handleFinished();};
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * Then, wherever you initialize the parent, initialize the sequence
 * object by pushing event times to it.
 * @code
 * m_pSequence = new mySequence(this);
 *
 * // three events, spaced 0.1 sec apart 
 * m_pSequence->pushTime(0.1);
 * m_pSequence->pushTime(0.2);
 * m_pSequence->pushTime(0.3);
 * // add event at 0.15 (note the order is enforced automatically)
 * m_pSequence->pushTime(0.15);
 * // final sequence times will be [0.1 0.15 0.2 0.3]
 * @endcode
 *
 * Later, when we want the sequence to "go":
 * @code
 * m_pSequence->doSequence();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The event handlers could be as simple as
 * @code
 * void SomeObj::handleEvent(unsigned int state)
 * {
 *     // "state" is the index of the time of the most recent event
 *     //  i.e. it counts up from 0 to the number of events - 1
 *     printf("Event %d occurred\n", state);
 * }
 *
 * void SomeObj::handleFinished()
 * {
 *     printf("The sequence is done.\n");
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
