/** @class MT_GLCanvasBase
 *
 * @brief Base class for OpenGL drawing and view management.
 *
 * This class is derived from wxGLCanvas and provides the context
 * on which all of our OpenGL drawing is done, including drawing
 * an image if MT_USE_IMAGES and MT_HAVE_OPENCV are defined.
 *
 * The main use of this class is as the "drawing area" on the 
 * main window of most MT applications.
 *
 * The most important thing to understand about the GL canvas
 * is that it defines two different coordinate systems.  The first
 * is the "Window" coordinate system, in which the top left
 * corner of the window is at (0,0) and the bottom right corner
 * is at (x,y) = (width, height) in pixels.  The second
 * coordinate system is the "Viewport" or "Drawing" coordinate
 * system.  This can be defined arbitrarily and corresponds
 * to the units that OpenGL will use for drawing objects.  
 * The default "Viewport" coordinate system defines the 
 * bottom left corner of the window as (0,0) and the top
 * right corner as (width, height) in pixels but with
 * double precision.
 *
 * There is some base functionality built in here:
 *  - Zoom management - 
 *     - If you press "z" and then draw a rectangle
 *        with the mouse, the "viewport" coordinate system 
 *        will zoom to that rectangle.
 *     - If you press "Z" the view will revert to the original.
 *  - Image display -
 *     - If MT_USE_IMAGES and MT_HAVE_OPENCV are defined,
 *        an image can be displayed on the canvas.
 *
 * I've tried to make it so that you don't have to worry about
 * this class.  Any functions that might need to get called here
 * should have an equivalent in MT_FrameBase.  If you find
 * yourself needing to call any functions here, check with me
 * to see if there's a safer way to do what you want to do or
 * maybe it's a design flaw that I can fix so you don't have to.
 *
 * I've made several of the methods here virtual, but I don't
 * intend for users to typically need to override them.  It's
 * done this way from a moral standpoint - i.e. if we were to
 * derive a class from this class these are the functions you
 * would probably want to have as virtual.
 *
 * The methods documented here are the ones that are most 
 * pertinent to understanding how the MT framework *works*,
 * hence the documentation is not intended to provide much
 * insight into how you should call these functions (because
 * you shouldn't need to).
 *
 * Note this frame is designed to be useful in two different
 * situations.  The "normal" situation is to be embedded
 * in an MT_FrameBase, in which case the various callbacks
 * are automatically passed on to the parent.  It can also
 * be used by itself (see, for example MT_CreateBackgroundDialog)
 * in which case only the base functionality callbacks are
 * used.
