The sample fish data is from a data set provided by Iain Couzin, icouzin@princeton.edu, and is intended only for you to test the application with.  If you wish to use the data in any other way, please contact Iain.  Tell him you got a small amount of sample data packaged in an application from Dan Swain and you're interested in using it for something.  He's a nice guy, he'll probably say yes.
