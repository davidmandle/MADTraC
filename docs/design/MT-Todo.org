MT-Todo.org
 This file is a plain-text outline of "Todo" items for MADTraC.  This file can be used with Emacs org-mode, but the plain-text nature means that it can be edited with any text editor (just try to follow the existing format).

* Overall
** Documentation!
*** Doxygen
    Each header file in the MT tree (except those in the 3rdparty
    branches) should have Doxygen-style documentation of constants,
    functions, classes, etc, that are intended for use by the user.
    This typically means public members and methods of all classes,
    though there are some methods and classes that are not necessary
    at the user level.
* PlaySwarm
** Object Sizing
   Object size is sometimes too small.  Additionally, the occlusion
   calculations are carried out with the automatically generated
   size.  I'm not sure if there's a better way to do this, though.
* MT_Core

** ParticleFile Plugins
   It would be nice if there was a way to add particle file reader
   plugins from user source code rather than modifying the MT source
   code.  This wouldn't be *too* hard to do...
** Other "support" files
   There are various simple "support" style functions scattered around
   the source tree that should be moved into MT/MT_Core/support/ in
   appropriate modules, e.g. stringsupport,
   filesystemsupport... Additionally there are functions in
   mathsupport that should be moved.  This will require some
   modifications to other source that includes mathsupport.h
** XML Robustness
   Errors when a key does not have a value (i.e. <key></key>).  Not
   sure if this is my fault or tinyxml.  Needs looking into.
